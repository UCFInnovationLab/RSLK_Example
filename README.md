# RSLK_Example


This example uses the left and right motor encoders.  To connect the encoders, four wire jumpers will need to be placed between the two encoder headers (2-pin 45 degree bent pins) and the red MSP432 board.
Use female to male jumpers to connect:

  * Left Encoder A connected to P6.4 (J1)                     .
  * Left Encoder B connected to P6.5 (J1)
  * Right Encoder A connected to P5.4 (J3)
  * Right Encoder B connected to P5.5 (J3)
